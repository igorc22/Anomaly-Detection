### 🧠 Anomaly Detection Credit Card 🔍

This project is developed using the machine learning algorithm KMeans with the goal of discovering and understanding behavioral patterns in our customer data. We used some techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to improve our model performance. We also cleansed the incorrect data points and outliers so we could use them for further analysis, performed feature engineering, and found new relevant features.
